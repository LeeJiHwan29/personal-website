            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my personal website! This site represents my journey as a student of Information Science and
                Engineering at University. I created this space to showcase who I am, what I’ve learned, and what I
                continue to explore in the world of web development. My interests lie in building functional,
                user-friendly websites that reflect both creativity and logic. I enjoy coding, experimenting with
                layouts, and solving real-world problems using digital tools.
                This website is divided into three main sections. The Home page introduces me and gives a brief
                background about my passion for technology. The Portfolio page displays some of the projects and
                accomplishments I’m most proud of—each one contributing to my growth as a developer. Lastly, the Trivia
                section includes a BMI calculator built with JavaScript to demonstrate how interactivity works in the
                browser.
                I’ve built this entire website using HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for
                functionality. It’s also hosted online as part of my coursework, helping me gain experience with live
                deployment and user interaction. I hope this site gives you a clear view of my interests and progress.
                Thank you for visiting, and feel free to reach out through the contact form!
